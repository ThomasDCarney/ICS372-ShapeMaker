# ICS372-ShapeMaker
A simple program to create shapes with different colors and saving them for future viewing.

## Purpose
This is/was a skill builder assignment as GUI elements and Serialization are used in the group projects. This was actually one our first non-Console assignemnts, illustrating the use of event listeners and elements provided by Java Swing. It was also one of our first attempts at working with saved data.

Not overly complex but the user is allowed to choose a shape, color and then select points on the canvas to define the objects boundries. If the "exit" option is chosen, the current drawing will be saved and recreated when the program starts up again.
